Second, people can, of course, change their nationalities, and there is clearly a huge role of choice there. Third, a person may be contented enough with his or her nationality, and yet may choose to work for the cause of national Independence of another country, or for the dignity and well-being of a foreign nation. It is important to see that the positive role of nationalism need not influence only those who happen to be, themselves, victims of foreign domination and of related indignites imposed on a subdued nation. Indeed, the fight against national subjugation need not be restricted only to persons who are born in the supressed nation. The search for justice against captivity can inspire others who come form elsewhere but who choose to join that struggle, moved by the cause of Independence and of regeneration o fan overpowered nation, and who come to develop a close bond with that underdog society.
