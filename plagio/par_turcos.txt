some others take aggregate import as a function of disaggregated income expenditure namely, consumption, investment and exports components (Tang (2005), Zhou and Dube (2011), Chani and Chaudhary (2012), Modeste (2011)). In these studies the rational of disaggregating income-expenditure is explained as avoiding aggregation bias resulting from use of a single aggregate expenditure variable in the import function when different macro components of final expenditure produce different impacts on imports.
